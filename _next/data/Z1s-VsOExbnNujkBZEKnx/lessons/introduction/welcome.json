In this workshop, you'll learn how to build robust, maintainable permission systems for real-world web applications. By the end, you'll understand the trade-offs between different authorization approaches and know how to implement them from scratch.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\n- The fundamental difference between **authentication** and **authorization**\n- How to implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with clean, type-safe code\n- How to build **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** for complex, dynamic permissions\n- When and why to consider **Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)**\n- How popular libraries like **CASL** and **Casbin** handle permissions\n- How to structure permission logic so it's easy to maintain and extend\n\n## What You'll Build\n\nThroughout this workshop, we'll progressively enhance a document management application. Starting with basic permission checks scattered throughout the codebase, we'll refactor and upgrade the system through multiple iterations:\n\n1. **Basic Permissions** → Inline checks with simple role comparisons\n2. **Structured RBAC** → Centralized role-permission mappings\n3. **Full ABAC** → Dynamic rules based on user attributes, resource properties, and context\n4. **Library Integration** → Migrating to CASL for production-ready permissions\n\nEach upgrade will demonstrate the strengths and limitations of different approaches, helping you choose the right tool for your specific needs.\n\n## Who This Workshop Is For\n\nThis workshop is designed for **fullstack web developers** who want to level up their authorization skills. You should be comfortable with:\n\n- **TypeScript** — 95% of the code we write is plain TypeScript\n- Basic understanding of databases and SQL concepts\n- General web development patterns (APIs, CRUD operations)\n\n> **Note:** While the demo application uses React and Next.js, you don't need prior experience with these frameworks. We'll focus almost entirely on the authorization logic, which is framework-agnostic TypeScript.\n\n## Workshop Format\n\nThis is a **hands-on, code-along workshop**.
