## What We Built

In this workshop, you learned:

- ✅ RBAC: Role-based route and action protection
- ✅ ABAC: Ownership, org scoping, field-level permissions
- ✅ ReBAC: Document sharing and relationship resolution
- ✅ Libraries: CASL deep dive, Casbin overview
- ✅ Custom engine: Built your own permission library
- ✅ Integration: Frontend components, backend middleware
- ✅ Production: Caching, auditing, testing

You now have the knowledge to implement robust authorization in any application.
